# SMD Reflow Hotplate

This is a currently still relatively rough draft of the software designed to run on a thermocouple based PID-controller board driven by a ESP12 microcontroller to precisely control the reflow cycle temperatures of any heatable surface or chamber.

The software is optimized to run on a specific PCB, designed to cover all needs while reflow soldering. It'll soon be available for purchase...
